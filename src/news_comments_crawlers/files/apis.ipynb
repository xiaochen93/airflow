New national team identity\\\\nAccording to the SSA, its new identity Red Lions is a \\\\\"symbol that sits on the highest ground and serves as the beacon of inspiration\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe logo, which depicts the head of a lion, symbolises courage, strength and excellence. The five stars on top represents the five aquatic disciplines within SSA - swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming.\\\\n2. National campaign and video\\\\n\\\\nAlong with its new identity, SSA also launched a national campaign called \\\\\"Swim with Us\\\\\" on March 14, which was unveiled by Minister for Manpower and Singapore National Olympic Council president Tan Chuan-Jin.\\\\nIt also released a video which depicts a young girl getting inspired after watching Singapore\\'s aquatic athletes such as Asian Games gold medallist Joseph Schooling in action on television.\\\\n3. Big year for aquatic sports in Singapore\\\\nAll eyes will be on the Red Lions during June\\'s South-east Asian (SEA) Games on home soil.\\\\n\\\\nThe venue, the OCBC Aquatic Centre at the Singapore Sports Hub, will also host three international competitions this year. They are the FINA World Junior Swimming Championships in August, as well as the FINA Swimming World Cup and FINA Diving Grand Prix, both in October.\\\\n4. How was the name chosen?\\\\nSSA\\'s Vice-President (Finance) Jose Raymond said \\\\\"there was a deep and detailed stakeholder engagement\\\\\" while deciding on the new national brand identity. Feedback from the athletes were taken into account and the name was a unanimous decision.\\\\n5. Seeking better engagement with fans\\\\nSSA is planning to revamp its website to provide more content for the public. It also expanded its reach on social media by setting up its Instagram, Twitter and YouTube accounts.\\\\nSingapore Armed Forces\\' airborne Red Lions\\\\n1. When were they formed?\\\\n\\\\nWhile freefall displays by the Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team have been a regular feature at National Day Parades, it was only in 1995 that the name Red Lions was formally coined.\\\\nThe team is part of the Singapore Armed Forces\\' Commando Formation.\\\\n2. Who came up with the name?\\\\nPach Ang, a veteran commando and Red Beret in the SAF Special Forces unit. According to a report in Sept 2014, Mr Ang clocked an impressive total of 3,500 jumps during his 32 years of service.\\\\nHe moved to Abu Dhabi in 2009 and founded professional event management company RedFilo. The name is a tribute to his parachute-jumping days - red refers to the colour of the distinctive beret he wore while in service, while \\\\\"Filo\\\\\" is special forces speak for \\\\\"first in, last out\\\\\".\\\\n3. What it takes to be a Red Lion\\\\n\\\\nThe team almost exclusively draws its members from the Commandos or the Naval Diving Unit. To qualify, a Red Lion must have made a minimum of 180 jumps. Training takes place on weekends.\\\\n4. They\\'re the best of the best\\\\nAt the 12th Asiania Four-way Formation Skydiving Championships - an annual Asia-Pacific competition - held from Oct 29 to Nov 7 2008 in the United Arab Emirates, the Red Lions beat 16 teams from 11 countries to clinch the top award.\\\\nThey have also participated in numerous international and regional competitions over the years.\\\\n5. They have a female daredevil in their ranks\\\\n\\\\nThird Warrant Officer Shirley Ng earned the distinction of being the first female Red Lion when she made her NDP debut in 2014. She was supposed to jump a year earlier, but the Red Lions segment was called off due to poor weather.\\\\n3WO Ng started out her SAF career as a certified rigger, whose job is to pack parachutes, in 1998. In an ST interview in July 2013, she said she overcame a wrist injury to be selected for a position mostly filled by commandos.\",\"title\":null,\"source_id\":1,\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.straitstimes.com\\\\/singapore\\\\/red-lions-controversy-5-things-to-know-about-the-two-groups-contesting-the-name\",\"lang\":\"EN\",\"topic_id\":null,\"org_title\":\"Red Lions controversy: 5 things to know about the two groups contesting the name\",\"deleted\":0,\"org\":1},{\"news_id\":115003,\"category\":\"World\",\"datetime\":1428364800000,\"content\":null,\"org_content\":\"Australian tourist Andrew Gaskell, who went missing in Mulu National Park in Sarawak, was found alive on Oct 31, 2016.\\\\nSearch and rescue teams had combed the Mulu summit in an effort to find Mr Gaskell, who had been missing since Oct 20 after embarking on a solo trek.\\\\nMore than 60 personnel were involved in the search-and-rescue effort, including those from the Fire and Rescue Department, the police, the civil defence force, as well as Sarawak Forestry rangers.\\\\nThe Mulu National Park, a Unesco world heritage site, has networks of vast caves, underground rivers and steep mountains, as well as sharp limestone walls.\\\\nREAD MORE HERE\\\\n\\\\nA missing Indonesian man was found alive, naked and floating in a huge volcanic lake on Oct 13, 2015, two days after the helicopter in which he was travelling crashed.\\\\nThe man, named in local reports as Fransiskus Subihardayan, was rushed to hospital after being found conscious but very weak, and wearing only a black watch, in Lake Toba, into which the aircraft is believed to have plummeted, on western Sumatra island.\\\\nThe survivor, in his 20s, was one of five people aboard the Eurocopter EC-130 when it disappeared Sunday during a short flight from Samosir island, a popular tourist spot on the lake, to the city of Medan.\\\\nREAD MORE HERE\\\\n\\\\nA man missing for six days in a remote Australian desert in searing heat without water was found on Oct 13, 2015, after surviving by eating black ants, the police said.\\\\nMr Reg Foggerdy, 62, disappeared on Oct 7 heading to the Shooter\\'s Shack camp near Laverton in the West Australian Goldfields, some 950km north-east of Perth, on a hunting trip.\\\\nWhen he failed to return, family members raised the alarm and a search by police trackers finally found him 15km from where he went missing.\\\\nREAD MORE HERE\\\\n\\\\nA 76-year-old man who lost his way while hiking was found near Upper Peirce Reservoir on Sept 7, 2015, after a 45-hour search by the authorities.\\\\nMr Ng Kang Leng had planned to walk from Dairy Farm Road towards MacRitchie Reservoir -
